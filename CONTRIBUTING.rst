   optimizing the complexity of certain functions, if an implementation
   seems not adequate to you, do not hesitate to modify it by opening a
   pull request, or to inform us by opening an issue.

Each of the following sub-sections will give you more information on the
opportunities listed below.

--------------

Getting Started
---------------

Before reading the sub-section that interests you in detail, here are some
golden rules that you should know before you contribute to ``pyRDF2Vec``:

-  **No contribution is too small:** submit as many fixes for typos and grammar
   bloopers as you can.
-  Whenever possible, **limit each pull request to one change only**.
-  **Add tests and docs for your code:** who better than you to explain and
   test that the code you have implemented works?
-  **Make sure your changes pass our CI:** during each commit several checks to
   verify the style of the code, the unit tests and the documentation are done
   though `tox
   <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__
   to avoid unpleasant surprises.
-  **Attach a short note to the pull request:** it would help us to better
   understand what you did.
-  **It's up to you how you handle updates to the main branch:** since we
   squash on merge, whether you prefer to rebase on ``main`` or merge
   ``main`` into your branch, do whatever is more comfortable for you.


Changelog
---------

If your change is noteworthy, there needs to be a changelog entry so our users
can learn about it!

To avoid merge conflicts, we use the `towncrier
<https://github.com/twisted/towncrier>`__ package to manage our changelog.
``towncrier`` uses independent files (called *news fragments*) for each pull
request. On release, those news fragments are compiled into our
``CHANGELOG.rst`` file.

Each file should be named like ``<ISSUE>.<TYPE>.rst``, where
``<ISSUE>`` is an issue number, and ``<TYPE>`` is one of:

* ``bugfix``: fixes a bug;
* ``doc``: documentation improvement, like rewording an entire session or
  adding missing docs;
* ``feature``: new user facing features, like a new walking strategy.

So for example: ``123.bugfix.rst``, ``456.feature.rst``.

Two scenarios exist for your pull request:

1. **if it fixes an issue**, use the issue number in the file name;
2. **otherwise**, use the pull request number.

If you are not sure what issue type to use, don't hesitate to ask in your pull
request.

``towncrier`` preserves multiple paragraphs and formatting (e.g., code
blocks, lists), but for entries other than ``feature`` it is usually better to
stick to a single paragraph to keep it concise.

If you would like to get a preview of how your change will look in
the final release notes, you can display the news fragments of the
``CHANGELOG`` file:

.. code:: bash

   tox -e changelog

From then on, you don't need to install ``towncrier`` yourself, you just have to abide by a
few simple rules:

- Wrap symbols like modules, functions, or classes into double backticks so
  they are rendered in a ``monospace font``.
- Wrap arguments into asterisks like in docstrings: *these* or *attributes*.
- If you mention functions or other callables, add parentheses at the end of
  their names: ``foo.func()`` or ``Foo.method()``.
  This makes the changelog a lot more readable.
- Prefer simple past tense or constructions with "now".
- If you would like to reference multiple issues, copy the news fragment to
  another filename. ``towncrier`` will merge all news fragments with identical
  contents into one entry with multiple links to the respective pull requests.

Example entries:

  .. code-block:: rst

     Added ``wallkers.Foo``.
     This walker is a new walker.

or:

  .. code-block:: rst

     ``fit_transform()`` now can deal with bigger Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE).

Conventions
-----------

We try as much as possible to follow Python conventions through the PEP
specifications. Don't be afraid of the list of conventions below. Indeed,
``tox`` and/or the CI will alert you and/or format your code for you if needed.

Here are the conventions established for ``pyRDF2Vec``:

-  `black <https://github.com/psf/black>`__: as code style, with a max line length of 79
   characters (according to `PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__);
-  `isort <https://github.com/PyCQA/isort>`__: to sort the imports;
-  `mypy <http://www.mypy-lang.org/>`__: as a optional static typing for Python
   (according to `PEP 484 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/>`__);
-  `doc8 <https://github.com/PyCQA/doc8>`__: as style checker for the
   documentation, with a max line length of 100 characters.

These checks are done by ``tox`` using `pre-commit
<https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit>`__.

Install the Dependencies
------------------------

Before contributing, it is important that you can install the pyRDF2Vec
dependencies in your environment. Whether you are using a Notebook or directly
your text editor, here is the preferred method:

Install `poetry <https://python-poetry.org/>`__:

.. code:: bash

   pip install poetry

With ``poetry`` installed, you can now install the dependencies related
to ``pyRDF2Vec`` in a virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

   poetry install

Now all you have to do is spawn a terminal to your virtual environment:

.. code:: bash

   poetry shell

If you prefer, you could contribute directly to ``pyRDF2Vec`` with the Docker
image and avoid installing dependencies on your machine:

.. code:: bash

   docker-compose up --build -d

Now you only have to go to `localhost:9000 <http://localhost:9000>`__.

Add a New Embedding Technique
-----------------------------

Adding a new embedding technique offers the possibility to have potentially
better results for some uses-cases when training a corpus of walks.

To achieve this, there are 5 points there are 5 points to follow:

1. **Create your embedder** (e.g., ``Foo``) in ``pyrdf2vec/embedders``.
2. **Import your embedder** in the ``pyrdf2vec/embedders/__init__.py`` file and
   in the ``__all__`` list:

.. code:: python

    from .embedder import Embedder
    from .foo import FooEmbedder
    from .word2vec import Word2Vec

    __all__ = [
        "Embedder",
        "FooEmbedder",
        "Word2Vec",
    ]

3. **Extend the** `Embedder
   <https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/blob/main/pyrdf2vec/embedders/embedder.py>`__
   **class** in your embedder's class and implement at least the ``fit`` and
   ``transform`` functions:

.. code:: python

    from typing import List

    import attr

    from pyrdf2vec.embedders import Embedder
    from pyrdf2vec.typings import Embeddings, Entities

    @attr.s
    class Foo(Embedder):
        """Defines Foo embedding technique."""

        def fit(self,  walks: List[List[SWalk]], is_updated: bool = False) -> Embedder:
            """Fits the model based on provided walks.

            Args:
                walks: The walks to create the corpus to to fit the model.
                is_update: True if the new walks should be added to old model's
                    walks, False otherwise.
                    Defaults to False.

            Returns:
                The fitted Foo model.

            """
            # TODO: to be implemented

        def transform(self, entities: Entities) -> Embeddings:
            """The features vector of the provided entities.

            Args:
                entities: The entities including test entities to create the
                embeddings. Since RDF2Vec is unsupervised, there is no label
                leakage.

            Returns:
                The features vector of the provided entities.

            """
            # TODO: to be implemented

4. **Create unit tests of your embedding technique:**

Create a ``tests/embedders/foo.py`` file and see `how the tests are done for
Word2Vec
<https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/blob/main/tests/embedders/test_word2vec.py>`__
as an example.

Once this is done, run your tests:

.. code:: bash

   pytest tests/samplers/foo.py

5. **Check that the code style and the documentation are still correct:**

.. code:: bash

   tox -e lint,docs


Everything ok? Make a `pull
request <https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/pulls>`__!


Add a New Walking Strategy
--------------------------

Adding a new walking strategy allows to perform on a new possibility to
extract walks for a given Knowledge Graph.

To add your own walking strategy, the steps are almost similar to those for
adding an embedding technique:

1. **Create your walker** (e.g., ``FooWalker``) in ``pyrdf2vec/walkers``.
2. **Import your walker** in the ``pyrdf2vec/walkers/__init__.py`` file and in
   the ``__all__`` list:

.. code:: python

    from .walker import Walker

    # ...
    from .foo import FooWalker
    # ...
    from .walklet import WalkletWalker
    from .weisfeiler_lehman import WLWalker

    __all__ = [
        # ...
        "FooWalker",
        # ...
        "Walker",
        "WalkletWalker",
        "WLWalker",
    ]

3. **Extend the** `Walker
   <https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/blob/main/pyrdf2vec/walkers/walker.py>`__
   **class** in your walker's class and implement at least the ``_extract``
   function:

.. code:: python

    from hashlib import md5
    from typing import List, Set

    import attr

    from pyrdf2vec.graphs import KG, Vertex
    from pyrdf2vec.typings import EntityWalks, SWalk, Walk
    from pyrdf2vec.walkers import Walker

    @attr.s
    class FooWalker(Walker):
        """Defines the foo walking strategy.

        Args:
            depth: The maximum depth of one walk.
            max_walks: The maximum number of walks per entity.
            sampler: The sampling strategy.
                Defaults to pyrdf2vec.samplers.UniformSampler().
            n_jobs: The number of process to use for multiprocessing.
                Defaults to 1.
            with_reverse: extracts children's and parents' walks from the root,
                creating (max_walks * max_walks) more walks of 2 * depth.
                Defaults to False.
            random_state: The random state to use to ensure random determinism to
                generate the same walks for entities.
                Defaults to None.

        """

        def _extract(self, kg: KG, instance: Vertex) -> EntityWalks:
            """Extracts walks rooted at the provided entities which are then
            each transformed into a numerical representation.

            Args:
                kg: The Knowledge Graph.
                instance: The instance to be extracted from the Knowledge Graph.

            Returns:
                The 2D matrix with its number of rows equal to the number of
                provided entities; number of column equal to the embedding size.

            """
            canonical_walks: Set[SWalk] = set()
            # TODO: to be implemented
            return {instance.name: list(canonical_walks)}

4. **Create unit tests of your walking strategy:**

Create a ``tests/walkers/foo.py`` file and see `how the tests are done for
RandomWalker
<https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/blob/main/tests/walkers/test_random.py>`__
as an example.

Once this is done, run your tests:

request <https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/pulls>`__!

Add a New Sampling Strategy
---------------------------

Adding a new sampling strategy performs a new way of assigning weights to links
in a Knowledge Graph.

To add your own sampling strategy, the steps are almost similar to those for
adding a walking strategy and a embedding technique:

1. **Create your sampler** (e.g., ``FooSampler``) in ``pyrdf2vec/samplers``.
2. **Import your sampler** in the ``pyrdf2vec/samplers/__init__.py`` file and
   in the ``__all__`` list:

.. code:: python

    from .sampler import Sampler

    # ...
    from .foo import FooSampler
    # ...
    from .uniform import UniformSampler

    __all__ = [
        # ...
        "FooSampler",
        # ...
        "Sampler",
        "UniformSampler",
    ]

3. **Extend the** `Sampler
   <https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/blob/main/pyrdf2vec/samplers/sampler.py>`__
   **class** in your sampler's class and implement at least the ``fit`` and
   ``get_weight`` functions:

.. code:: python

    import attr

    from pyrdf2vec.graph import KG
    from pyrdf2vec.samplers import Sampler
    from pyrdf2vec.typings import Hop

    @attr.s
    class FooSampler(Sampler):
        """Defines the Foo sampling strategy."""

        def fit(self, kg: KG) -> None:
            """Since the weights are uniform, this function does nothing.

            Args:
                kg: The Knowledge Graph.

            """
            # TODO: to be implemented

        def get_weight(self, hop: Hop) -> int:
            """Gets the weight of a hop in the Knowledge Graph.

            Args:
                hop: The hop (pred, obj) to get the weight.

            Returns:
                The weight for a given hop.

            """
            # TODO: to be implemented

4. **Create unit tests of your sampling technique:**

Create a ``tests/samplers/foo.py`` file and see `how the tests are done for
UniformSampler
<https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/blob/main/tests/samplers/uniform.py>`__
as an example.

Once this is done, run your tests:

.. code:: bash

   pytest tests/samplers/foo.py

5. **Check that the code style and the documentation are still correct:**

.. code:: bash

   tox -e lint,docs

Add a New Connector
-------------------

Add a new connector to extend the use of ``pyRDF2Vec`` to other syntax and file
formats in RDF (e.g., Turtle syntax)

To add your own connector, the steps are almost similar to those previously
illustrated:

1. **Create your connector** (e.g., ``FooConnector``) in ``pyrdf2vec/connectors``.
2. **Import your connector** in the ``pyrdf2vec/connector/__init__.py`` file.
3. **Extend the** `Connector
   <https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/blob/main/pyrdf2vec/connectors.py>`__
   **class** in your connector's class and implement at least the ``fetch``
   function:

.. code:: python

    import attr
    from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
    from requests.packages.urllib3.util import Retry

    from pyrdf2vec.connectors import Connector

    @attr.s
    class FooConnector(Connector):
        """Represents a Foo connector."""

        def __attrs_post_init__(self):
            adapter = HTTPAdapter(
                Retry(
                    total=3,
                    status_forcelist=[429, 500, 502, 503, 504],
                    method_whitelist=["HEAD", "GET", "OPTIONS"],
                )
            )
            self._session.mount("http", adapter)
            self._session.mount("https", adapter)

        def fetch(self, query: str) -> None:
            """Fetchs the result of a query.

               Args:
                   query: The query to fetch the result.

               Returns:
                   The generated dictionary from the ['results']['bindings']
                   json.

            """
            # TODO: to be implemented

4. **Create unit tests of your connector:**

Create a ``tests/connectors/foo.py`` file and see `how the tests are done for
SPARQLConnector
<https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/blob/main/pyrdf2vec/connectors.py>`__
as an example.

Once this is done, run your tests:

.. code:: bash

   pytest tests/connectors/foo.py

5. **Check that the code style and the documentation are still correct:**

.. code:: bash

   tox -e lint,docs

Everything ok? Make a `pull
request <https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/pulls>`__!


Improve the Online Documentation
--------------------------------

The `online documentation of
pyRDF2Vec <https://pyrdf2vec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ is hosted on
`Read the Docs <https://readthedocs.org/>`__. To generate this online
documentation, we use:

- `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/main/>`__ as a Python documentation generator ;
-  `Google Style
   docstrings <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/main/usage/extensions/example_google.html>`__:
   as a docstring writing convention.
- ``mypy``: as a optional static typing for Python.

To update the documentation, 4 steps are essential:

1. **Modify what needed to be modified in the documentation**: available in the
   ``docs`` folder.

2. **Generate this documentation locally**:

.. code:: bash

   tox -e docs

3. **Check that the changes made are correct with your web browser:**

.. code:: bash

   $BROWSER _build/html/index.html

4. **Check that the code style of the documentation is still correct:**

.. code:: bash

   tox -e lint

--------------------------------

Feel free to `open an issue
<https://github.com/IBCNServices/pyRDF2Vec/issues/new/choose>`__ in case something is
not working as expected, or if you have any questions/suggestions.

Improve the Code
----------------

The refactoring and optimization of code complexity is an art that must
be necessary to facilitate future contributions of ``pyRDF2Vec``.

To improve the code, 2 steps are essential:

1. **Make your modifications**.
2. **Run unit tests, check that the code style and documentation are still correct:**
